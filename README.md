# SNAP_IA_Thalem
Interthalamic adhesion's mask on the Thalem 1 &amp; 2 datasets from Toulouse

SNAP_Thalem_gituhub.ods comprises some demographical data, the IA's characterization by two raters (presence, absence, variant), the number of voxels (1mm3) by masks and the mean area by masks corrected by the partial volume effect. Up to 4 masks by IA could be segmented to consider as much 3D information as possible. 

T1w MRI data can be shared on request.
