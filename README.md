# SNAP_IA_Thalem
Interthalamic adhesion's mask on the Thalem 1 &amp; 2 datasets from Toulouse

Those analyses follow a protocol named SNAP, which is in preparation.

The IA_overlap_Thalem.zip file contains all the IA's masks by subject. Those masks are the overlap of two raters' segmentation when the Dice coefficient was superior to 0.80, demonstrating high agreement.

SNAP_Thalem_gituhub.ods comprises some demographical data, the IA's characterization by two raters (presence, absence, variant), the number of voxels (1mm3) by masks and the mean area by masks corrected by the partial volume effect. Up to 4 masks by IA could be segmented to consider as much 3D information as possible. 

T1w MRI data can be shared on request.
